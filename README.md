# TicTacToe
TicTacToe Group Project CSIS 1410

Hopping off now, I haven't been able to figure out how to add the turn tracking functionality in the Controller class. I started with something, but I'm not convinced it's the right approach. Going to return to it later with fresh eyes. 

Project requirements are that it includes: <br>
a minimum of three classes <br>
a graphical user interface <br>
a generic collection <br>
file IO (It needs to read from and write to a file) <br>
