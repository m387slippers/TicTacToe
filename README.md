# TicTacToe
TicTacToe Group Project CSIS 1410

Going to try and add some turn tracking functionality in the Controller class like a getter and a setter to be called by event listener for button click. 

Project requirements are that it includes: <br>
a minimum of three classes <br>
a graphical user interface <br>
a generic collection <br>
file IO (It needs to read from and write to a file) <br>
